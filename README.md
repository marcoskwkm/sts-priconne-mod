# Princess Connect Skins Mod

This is a Slay the Spire mod that reskins the default characters into Princess Connect characters (Pecorine, Kyaryl and Kokkoro).

This mod was built on top of Leucogeranus7744's [Princess](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3239054915) [Connect](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3239704666) [mods](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3239074040). The purpose of this mod is to allow using any skin with any STS character, since the original mods tied each Princess Connect character to a particular STS character, leaving Watcher with no custom skin.

This mod was bootstrapped using [Basic Mod](https://github.com/Alchyr/BasicMod). Please follow the [Basic Mod guide](https://github.com/Alchyr/BasicMod/wiki) to see how to build and use this mod.

I do not own any of the sprites used and all credits go to the original authors.

# Disclaimer

I made this mod for my own personal use. I haven't tested it enough so it can be buggy. Use it at your own risk. Feel free to open an issue if you encounter any problems.

# Known bugs

- Skin selection is not preserved when you save and restart the game (it defaults to Pecorine with default skin). This is not a priority to me because I usually do runs in a single playthrough, but feel free to open a PR with a fix.
